# Mission to Mars!

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape the latest news and image data about Mars from NASA and display it on one easy-to-read web page.

## Usage

Once the page, created with Flask, is running, all a user needs to do is click the "Scrape New Data" button in order to retrieve the latest article, image, and information about Mars

Not only does the script retrieve the latest data, it also retrieves hi-res images of each of Mars' hemispheres. See below for example of all aggregated data:
